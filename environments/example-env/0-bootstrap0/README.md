# Define ArgoCD Projects

Define the projects that will be used to organize your **Application** resources
in ArgoCD across all environments.
These should be expressed as ArgoCD **AppProject** resources.

See the ArgoCD [Projects](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/)
and [Project Specification](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/project-specification/)
documentation for more information.
